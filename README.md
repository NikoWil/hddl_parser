# hddl_parser

This is a parser for the hddl language as described in **HDDL – A Language to Describe Hierarchical Planning Problems** by Höller et al.
The goals of this parser are:
- To be easy to build, i.e., just download and execute a single command to get a usable library
- To be platform independent, i.e., work on at least Linux and Windows (as those are the platforms I can easily verify)
- To be easy to integrate with other programs, i.e., present a simple C-interface to integrate with
